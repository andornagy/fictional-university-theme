# Practice Project

This is a practice project I did while going through the Become a WordPress Developer: Unlocking Power With Code on Udemy by Brad Schiff

## Installation

The theme should work as-is. However, it requires an MU-plugin, for registering the custom post types. Check the mu-plugins folder for that.

If you wish to make JS or SCSS changes, make sure to run


```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Simple extract the zip inside wp-content/themes and place the `university-post-types.php` from the `mu-plugins` into the `mu-plugins` folder found in `wp-content`.

This is required for the custom post types, such as campuses, professors, events, and the professor-like system to work.
